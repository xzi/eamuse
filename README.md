# Katie's eAmusement Tracker

A tracker for eAmusement maintenances written using Javascript.

Todo list:
- [ ] Make the timer
- [ ] Find some way to calculate when extended maintenances are
- [ ] Write something that explains what this is and how it works
- [ ] Improve layout to not be whatever the hell I just cooked up
- [ ] Cats?
